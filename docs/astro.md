# Astro

Reusable Astro components, layouts, and stylesheets. Derive a project's root
layout from `astro/layouts/LayoutBase.astro` to get started. This layout:

- Allows for the inclusion of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) by name.
- Sets all text to use Arial by default.
- Provides the `sr-only` CSS class that makes text visible only to screen readers.
